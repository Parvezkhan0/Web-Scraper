# Web-Scraper
 Build a web scraper using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. The scraper can extract data from a website of your choice, such as headlines, product information, or weather data, and save it to a local file or database. This project will give you hands-on experience with web requests, HTML parsing, and data extraction.
